# rockPaperScissors
Rock paper scissors game where a player play against the computer
First step: I created a function that randomly return either ‘Rock’, ‘Paper’ or ‘Scissors’. 
Second step: I created a playRound function where both player and computer plays.
Last step: I created a game function that compile all the games played and announce the overall winner.
